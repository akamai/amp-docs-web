This tutorial shows how to implement chapters based on WebVTT spec.

==== How to add chapter markers using WebVTT

Adding navigation markers for the video timeline can be done using a WebVTT file.
A WebVTT file can consist in chapters that are plain text typically just a single line whose text is interpreted as a chapter title that describes the chapter as a navigation target.

To add chapter markers in AMP a `track` object must be passed along the `media` object, indicating the file location, language and kind.
Please refer to {@link akamai.amp.Media} and {@link akamai.amp.Track} to know more about the media and track interfaces.

==== Multi-language chapter markers

Alternatively, different languages tracks can be provided into a single `media` object, making the timeline UI to match the user's preferred language.
