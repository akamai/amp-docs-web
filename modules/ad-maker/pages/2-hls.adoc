Ad Marker plugin allows user to get ad avail information from their HLS manifest.

=== Supported ad tags

Plugin only supports the following ad tags:

* EXT-X-CUE
* EXT-X-CUE-OUT
* EXT-X-CUE-IN
* EXT-X-CUE-OUT-CONT
* EXT-OATCLS-SCTE35

=== Ad Marker Tagging

This section demonstrates how to implement the ad marker plugin for ad tagging depending on the style of the HLS manifest

==== CUE-IN CUE-OUT Ad Tags

Whether `EXT-X-CUE-OUT` or `EXT-X-CUE-IN` is detected within the HLS live manifest, player fires an event containing the ad avail information along the companion tags.

==== Continuation Ad Tag

In some cases the HLS manifest only provides a continuation tag `EXT-X-CUE-OUT-CONT` indicating that an ad break is in progress.

==== SCTE35 Markers

As an alternative, Ad marker plugin supports base64 encoded SCT35 messages alongside the EXT-OATCLS-SCTE35 tag. If found, plugin will throw a `scte35` event along the decoded scte35 message.
