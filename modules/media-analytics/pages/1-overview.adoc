This tutorial will show you how to properly implement Akamai Media Analytics using the AMPlayer Media Analytics Plugin.

To check the final result, visit our <a href='https://player.akamai.com/demos/'>demo page</a>, under the "Measurement" section.

Steps:

Create a <a href='https://developer.akamai.com/tools/AdaptiveMediaPlayer/docs/web/amp-web-media-analytics/akamai.amp.mediaanalytics.MediaAnalyticsConfig.html'>Media Analytics Config</a> object:

Include the <a href='https://developer.akamai.com/tools/AdaptiveMediaPlayer/docs/web/akamai.amp.PlayerResource.html'>Player Resource</a> objects array required to load the MA Library and Plugin. This values dont change.

Include the url to the MA library configuration xml:

To enable/disable the IP look up, include "iplookup: true/false"

A key-value object `dimensions` should be included to track any desired dimension.

If you have any custom dimension configured in your report pack you can use that one the same way, by adding a key for your custom dimension and its value. As an example, imagine we have configured the custom dimension “eventName” in our report pack, to report the current event being broadcasted. Here is how our dimensions object will look:

Once you have properly configured your <a href='https://developer.akamai.com/tools/AdaptiveMediaPlayer/docs/web/amp-web-media-analytics/akamai.amp.mediaanalytics.MediaAnalyticsConfig.html'>Media Analytics Config</a> object add it to the plugins sections in your configuration object. Notice that the plugin name is "mediaanalytics".
