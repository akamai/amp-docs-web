This tutorial shows how to integrate Yospace ads with AMP.

This page covers:
* Providing AMP with a configuration object for Yospace.
* Providing AMP with the Yospace SDK and Yospace AMP plugin resource objects.

==== 1. Providing AMP with a configuration object for Yospace

As a first step to include any of AMP plugins, it is needed to include a {@link akamai.amp.PluginConfig} for the desired plugin. In the case of Yospace is needed to include the `yospace` object (see {@link akamai.amp.yospace.YospaceConfig}) as part of the plugin configurations.

==== 2. Providing AMP with the Yospace SDK and Yospace AMP plugin resource objects

A {@link akamai.amp.Resource} must be included inside the Yospace configuration for both the Yospace SDK and the Yospace Plugin. If you have a custom version of the Yospace SDK you can use its url instead of the standard version by replacing the `src`.
